    Starting Fall of 2008, I developed a simple RIS system to
    read in our reports to our PACS system. It maintained accession
    numbers and patient data allowing us to track start and stop times of
    exams and produce metrics for tracking wait times and report turn
    around. We used this program four years until replacing it with a
    hospital EHR. I built it with ruby on rails. I learned lots during this
    time and consider it one of the most enjoyable parts of my job at TSSH.
    It turns out that we should not have sunsetted the system when we did.
    The EHR did not live upto its name and we recently re-implemented lots of what
    I had already done with this program.

        As the PACS Admin, I maintained the picture archiving and communication system.
        It is basically an Oracle db on steroids. It has a viewer for the Radiologists to
        read the images obtained during imaging. I taught the doctor's how to use the
        viewer and made sure it was installed correctly on their machines.
