I like to program and build websites. I built a website for my in-laws
business several years ago, www.tulsagrass.com and www.ospa.us, and my
blog, justin.jetfive.com. www.jetfive.com runs on heroku. The
tulsagrass site runs on Rackspace. My blog uses github pages. I also
have a raspberry pi as a server at home.

I like to read. I like to study the Bible. I like listening to
podcasts while doing yard work.

I have spent countless hours yak shaving .emacs.d.
